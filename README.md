- Also Action.cpp must be same as Events classes
- View.cpp needs to be setup all UI elements, in another thread.
- Add Dynamic Line Numbering
- Add Custom highlighters
- Run QScintilla component and its' instances in another thread
- Add Find&Replace
- Add CScope wrapper
- Refactor marked methods
- Delete View XML and implement them with C++ (same with #4)
